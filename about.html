        <p>I'm a 28 year old Wisconsin native with a passion for design and all things creative. I started teaching myself to code in 2018 as a hobby, and when the pandemic hit in 2020, I decided I should go ahead and get a second degree. Throughout my education at MATC, I have developed and refined my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and the Adobe Suite.</p>
        <p>I also graduated in 2016 from the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a bachelor's degree in Environmental Studies and History. I then worked and traveled around Europe, moved to Madrid where I got my teaching certification, and worked in Vietnam for a year as an English instructor. During the transitory periods between these life phases, I have supported myself by working in the service industry. All these experiences have shaped me into a well-rounded individual with valuable people skills.</p>
        <p>In the world of web development, my main interests include web design, graphic design, and user experience. I enjoy the whole process of designing a good website that both functions well and looks spectacular.</p>
        <p>In my spare time, I enjoy long distance running, photography, reading, traveling, and being outdoors.</p>
