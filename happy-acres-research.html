            <h2>User Expectations and Impressions</h2>
            <h3>What is your (first) impression of this product?</h3>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 1:</span> Seems like a fun campground if you have kids. Personally I wouldn&#39;t go there.</p>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 2:</span> Would not camp here because there are probably a lot of children.</p>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 3:</span> Family centered.</p>
            <h3>What&#39;s most appealing about this product/service?</h3>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 1:</span> It seems like there&#39;s a lot to do at this campground, so no one will get bored on the camping trip.</p>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 2:</span> Activities and swimming area</p>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 3:</span> Lots to do, variety of camping options, something for everyone.</p>
            <h3>What&#39;s the hardest part about using this product/service?</h3>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 1:</span> Walls of text make it super hard to read. Not aesthetically pleasing at all.</p>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 2:</span> Too much text on every page!</p>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 3:</span> There is no “About Us” introductory page, so I had to figure out what this place is.</p>
            <h3>Was there anything surprising or unexpected about this product/service?</h3>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 1:</span> Can&#39;t make a reservation online.</p>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 2:</span> The year is 2022, yet reservations are made by phone only?!?</p>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 3:</span> There is no attempt to market the campground as a fun place, no effort to persuade people to go there, no happy descriptions of things to do.  The website is strictly information, facts and rules (many rules), with repetitive reminders about requiring full payment in advance.  I found these things to be negative and off-putting.</p>
        </div> 
        <div class="user-story happy-acres-users">
            <h2>GENERAL TASK-DRIVEN FEEDBACK</h2>
            <h3>How would you go about finding and reserving a campsite?</h3>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 1:</span> Use the site map and then call the place.</p>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 2:</span> Calling the campground.</p>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 3:</span> First go to Reservations, then Campsite Map, then Cabins to check the
                        options, then Rates, then make a phone call.
                        </p>
            <h3>What do you expect to happen if you try to reserve a campsite?</h3>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 1:</span> I expect them to help me over the phone, the website doesn&#39;t make it particularly easy.</p>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 2:</span> Probably would have an annoying conversation with someone who hates their job.</p>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 3:</span> I would expect the person answering the phone to ask what kind of
                        campsite I am interested in and what dates, tell me what was available, and
                        help me use the map to locate and choose the site I want. Then, of course,
                        I would be asked for my credit card information. Hopefully he/she would
                        give me information on checking in (I couldn&#39;t find it on the website, other than
                        check-in time).
                        </p>
            <h3>What alternative method would you use or suggest to find and reserve a campsite?</h3>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 1:</span> Have a way to do it online. Be able to see which sites are available for specific dates.</p>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 2:</span> Use an online reservation system that shows available sites with pricing, and provide pictures of the campsites.</p>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 3:</span> They definitely need an online reservation option.</p>
            <h3>Was anything surprising or did not perform as expected?</h3>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 1:</span> Again, weird that you can&#39;t reserve online. </p>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 2:</span> Why were there so many different navigation bars and why were they inconsistent??</p>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 3:</span> I had no trouble navigating the website.</p>

            <h2>Follow-up Questions</h2>
            <h3>What is your (first) impression of this site?</h3>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 1:</span> The nav bar looks good but the information on all the pages is too hard to read. I felt like it took so much effort to find the information I needed.</p>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 2:</span> Why so much text???</p>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 3:</span> Tired, blah.</p>
            <h3>Do you feel this design was made for you? Why or why not?</h3>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 1:</span> No, this design was not made for anyone. People need to be able to read things more easily and the site needs to be more intuitive. </p>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 2:</span> No, it was way too busy.</p>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 3:</span> No. There is nothing that draws me in. Photographs are sparse and poorly
                        done, clip art on some pages is amateurish.</p>
            <h3>What was the one thing you liked the most about the design?</h3>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 1:</span> The color scheme is pretty good for a campground website. </p>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 2:</span> The header image with title is nice, but the picture is bad quality.</p>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 3:</span> The tabs are easy to navigate.</p>
            <h3>What was the one thing you disliked the most about the design?</h3>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 1:</span> Not enough high quality images. More visuals would be great.</p>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 2:</span> The landing page had too much text and 3 navigation bars. The one in the middle of the page used too many colors in no particular order.</p>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 3:</span> Too much uninterrupted text.</p>
            <h3>If you could change one thing about the design, what would it be?</h3>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 1:</span> Add more high quality images.</p>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 2:</span> The rates page was completely different from the rest of the pages and looked like a PDF, I would change it to be more cohesive with the rest of the page.</p>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 3:</span> Make it warm, positive and welcoming.</p>
            <h3>Would you use this product if the change(s) were made?</h3>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 1:</span> I wouldn&#39;t, but if I had kids maybe I would want to go to this campground.</p>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 2:</span> No, because it wouldn&#39;t change the amount of children that would be at this campground.</p>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 3:</span> Yes, if I had young children and wanted an easy, nearby place to go for a
                        day or two.
                        </p>
            <h3>Do you feel this is something for the desktop? Mobile? Or both?</h3>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 1:</span> It should work for both. </p>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 2:</span> Desktop, or neither!</p>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 3:</span> Definitely desktop or laptop only. The crowded pages have too much
                        information to successfully navigate on a phone.
                        </p>
            <h3>Would you recommend this to a family member or friend?</h3>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 1:</span> Not the website itself, but maybe the campground if I had friends with kids.</p>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 2:</span> No.</p>
                    <p><span class="user-interview">User 3:</span> Perhaps to a family with young children.</p>

                <p class="quote">“As a first-time camper, I want to learn what supplies and equipment are recommended in order to have a positive camping experience."</p>
                    <p>John is excited to have an outdoor adventure, but he is new to camping and doesn&#39;t know how to prepare or what to bring. He could benefit from a packing list or other tips for first-time campers.</p>
                    <p>John is trying to plan the camping trip, but is getting overwhelmed at the amount of information and research it involves. He wishes someone could just help him through the whole process so it wouldn&#39;t be as frustrating.</p>
                    <p>John would benefit from a page on the campground&#39;s website that goes over camping basics for inexperienced people. He needs a basic recommended packing list, a list of gear and supplies he&#39;d be able to rent from the campground, and details about the campground&#39;s amenities. He also needs to be able to use an interactive map to choose and reserve a campsite on the company&#39;s website.</p>

                    <p>Jill is a highly organized, detail-oriented individual who loves to plan. She is good at taking all possible scenarios into account when planning a trip. </p>
                    <p>Jill wants to plan a family friendly camping trip with her kids. She wants to be aware of all the details, such as weather, permits, rules, amenities, and so on. </p>
                    <p>Jill needs to be able to easily locate all the necessary information on the campground&#39;s website. The information should be logically organized into separate web pages, and then into chunks that make it easy to scan for relevant info. The website should have an interactive map to make it easier to choose and reserve a campsite. </p>

                <p class="quote">“As a dad with a full-time job, I want to easily find everything I need online because I don&#39;t like busywork and I hate talking on the phone.”</p>
                    <p>Steve is a divorced dad of two, and when he gets weekends with his kids, he tries to make the time fun and meaningful. Rather than being in control of everything, he prefers to sit back and let the kids explore and try new things. </p>
                    <p>Steve is looking for a place that&#39;s family friendly with a variety of activities to keep everyone entertained. This is the first time he&#39;s taking the kids camping and he wants to make it special for them as well as for himself. He wants to try fishing again, which he hasn&#39;t done for many years.</p>
                    <p>Steve isn&#39;t looking to spend a lot of time planning the trip, so he needs the website to have logically organized information that is easy to scan. He needs concise sections about amenities and activities, and he would also benefit greatly from a reviews/ratings section. As a highly visual person, Steve would also benefit from high quality photos or videos of the campground as well as an interactive map. </p>
